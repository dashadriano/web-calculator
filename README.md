# Web Calculator
Calculator mini project. Built on HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Abstract
Calculator mini project capable of doing the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

Allows for floating-point numbers. 

# How It Works
As a small scale web based project, the web calculator operates through an HTML file, utilizing it as the backbone of the project, a CSS file for style, and a JavaScript file for functionability. 

Through consideration of user-friendliness, the GUI was developed to offer a layout that may be similar to a traditional calculator app that users may have already seen, and one that is familiar enough to use effortlessly in doing basic operations.
